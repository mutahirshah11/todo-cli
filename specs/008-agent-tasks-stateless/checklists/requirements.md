# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 3.3 Agent-Driven Task Management (Stateless Backend)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-20
**Feature**: [specs/008-agent-tasks-stateless/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated by Agent.
- "Neon DB" and "MCP" references are retained as they are explicit system constraints/actors defined in the requirements, not implementation choices.
- Assumption regarding conversation history handling in stateless environment added to Edge Cases.
